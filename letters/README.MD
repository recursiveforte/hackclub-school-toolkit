# Letters to IT & Administrators

Hack Clubs allow creative students to create technical projects. Tools such as [GitHub](https://github.com/)(maintained by Microsoft), [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)(maintained by Adobe), and [Replit](https://replit.com/) are widely used in the tech industry and play a vital role in empowering creators. Hack Clubs around the world use these tools to build awesome projects, but sometimes schools or districts may block these tools. As a Hack Club leader, you can contact your school or district’s IT department requesting that they unblock these websites, so your Hack Club can do what they do best: build awesome projects together.

Below, we’ve provided a couple of examples of letters sent to IT departments in hopes of getting these core tools unblocked. We hope these letters inspire you to reach out to your school’s IT Department and request that the tools your Hack Club need get unblocked!
