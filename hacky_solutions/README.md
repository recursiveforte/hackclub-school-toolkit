# Hacky Solutions
## Safari
This one is niche, but if you or your club members happen to be on Macs and pay for iCloud storage(iCloud+), using Safari can be a simple solution because of Private Relay, which is a "proxy" built in to Safari.

## GitLab/BitBucket
While some schools have blocked GitHub, it is possible that they have not blocked [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/) or [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/).

## Cloud Central Repo
If GitHub, GitLab, and BitBucket are all blocked, you can make one repo in a cloud service for your club, give all your memebers a folder, and have them use that for versian control. 

## Proxy/VPN **USE AT YOUR OWN RISK**
If your school's disciplinary policies are combatible with this, this is a simple solution. Again, **USE AT YOUR OWN RISK**.

## CodeSpaces
If you are unable to install IDEs want a good web IDE, [GitHub CodeSpaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) is a good solution for this, assuming GitHub is not blocked.

## Mass Advisors
If you are unable to find an adivsor that is STEM focused, finding a person who advises large numbers of clubs even if they are not a STEM teacher could help because them advising a lage number of clubs shows they are up to the task.
